## Communication

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* Please go through the User Guide to see if the problem is already addressed. Most common problems are already addressed in Troubleshooting and FAQs sections.
* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe your environment - OS Version, Java version, Browsers used and their versions etc.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Do check if it is an issue with the third party libraries used. For example Web-Execution and Element Finding issues could be mostly related to Selenium. We will not be able to support issues related to third party libraries.
* If the issues are related to execution attach the `console.txt` and reports if possible.
* If you are facing any issue with the UI attach screenshots and `log.txt` present in the installation location.

### Suggesting Enhancements

* Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Cognizant Customer Experience Assurance Viewer 2.0 users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package
